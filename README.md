# Langchain Projects

This repository contains multiple projects related to LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Each project serves a different purpose, ranging from Q&A systems to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) implementations and SQL-based text processing.

1. MathsGPT

A GPT-based system focused on solving mathematical problems.

2. QandA

A simple question-answering system using LangChain.

3. RAG & RAG.1

Implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation using research papers.

4. SQLTXT

Uses SQL databases for text processing and retrieval.

5. Text Summarization

A notebook-based project for summarizing text using LLMs.

6. CodeLlama

Uses CodeLlama for code generation and analysis.

7. ConversationalBot

A conversational chatbot that answers queries interactively.

8. LangChain Experiments

Various experiments related to embeddings, data ingestion, and vector storage.

9. SimpleApp

A basic LangChain application to demonstrate simple functionality.
